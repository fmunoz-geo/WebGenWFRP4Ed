    <h2>WFRP 4th Edition Random treasure</h2>
 <p>This is a simple treasure generator, currently it creates 5 random pieces of jewelry, clothes, weapons, armours and other things you could find adventuring in the Old World (the plan is to make it more flexible and with a larger set of items).<br>
If you need people you might meet in a <a href="https://pacomiscelaneousstuff.blogspot.com/2020/03/wfrp-inn-generator.html">tavern</a> check my <a href="https://pacomiscelaneousstuff.blogspot.com/2019/08/npc-generator.html">NPC Generator</a> to create Merchants, Scholar, Soldiers and similar citizens.<br>
If you need a more dangerous set you might check my <a href="https://pacomiscelaneousstuff.blogspot.com/2019/08/monster-generator.html">Monster Generator</a> to create Mutants, Orcs, Goblins or worse.<br>
To have a more detailed Old Worlders you can use the list of my <a href="https://pacomiscelaneousstuff.blogspot.com/2018/09/generic-npc-stats-for-4th-edition.html">Generic NPCs stats for 4th edition</a>.<br>
